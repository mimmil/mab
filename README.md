## Introduction

Although this game is clearly inspired by Warcraft, it should not be taken as like-for-like lore or use of language as it is entirely made up. Murlocs and Boomsticks is overly simplified and lazily researched.

It is therefore no surprise that even this introduction is packed with tongue-in-cheek comments and that the game is entirely meant to be taken as fun.

Any resemblence to murlocs living or dead is purely coincidental.

---

## What You Need <a name="whatyouneed"></a>

To play Murlocs and Boomsticks you will need paper, pencils, a sense of humor, and a six-sided dice (1d6).

---

## Classes

Everyone always starts by wanting to know what classes they can play. Why is that important? Being a murloc should be far more important! In Murloc and Boomsticks the topic is addressed this way; there are just two classes.

||Murloc Shaman|Murloc Peon|
|---|---|---|
|Armor|Loin Cloth|Loin Cloth|
|Weapon|None|Seashell|
|Gold|5 coins|10 coins|
|Food|Conjured Muffin|None|

The Murloc Shaman is revered as being the most imbalanced self-healing magic wielding cave dweller. There are few limits to their damp powers, only hindered by your terrible dice rolls.

Murloc Peons have no magic and are far less overpowered. They do however have one ability that the shaman lack; the ability to do absolutely anything that does not involve magic. Although a shaman would argue that with enough magic, anything can be done.

---

## Creating a Character <a name="charactercreation"></a>
* **Step 1.** Choose your class: **Shaman** or **Peon**.

* **Step 2.** Roll 1d6 to choose a role; **Healer**, **Tinker**, or **Hunter**.

|Dice Roll|Role|Health|Starting Item|
|---|---|---|---|
|1 or 2|Healer|3|Healing Potion|
|3 or 4|Tinker|4|Lantern|
|5 or 6|Hunter|5|Pointy Stick|

* **Step 3.** Roll 1d6 to determine your skill modifier, depending on your class.

#### Shaman
|Dice Roll|Modifier|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|1, 2 or 3|Magic|Away with the fairies.|
|4, 5 or 6|Non-magic|Can perform some mental activities.|

> Mental activities involve using your brain, e.g. bluffing, thinking, logic, deception, and so on.

#### Peon
|Dice Roll|Modifier|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|1, 2 or 3|Mental|Excels at mental activities.|
|4, 5 or 6|Physical|More suited to physical activities.|

> A physical activity is anything that is not related to magic or mental ability.

&nbsp;

* **Step 4.** Select one goal from the list, or roll 1d6 to choose randomly;
    1. Slay Adventurers
    2. Horde Treasure
    3. Seek out Mysteries
    4. Become King Mrgl-Mrgl
    5. Stay Alive
    6. Join the Darkmoon Faire

* **Step 5.** Choose a Murloc name.

* **Step 6.** If you selected shaman as your class, you get to specialise in **3 schools** and **2 techniques** of spellweaving. All shaman may use **all spellweaving modifiers**. This is your spellbook. It is a physical book. Peons get a pet rock.

## Gameplay

1. Players create their characters.
2. The game master sets the scene; introducing the storyline, the who, why, what, where and when.
3. Players take turns to explain what they want to do.
4. The game master prompts for roles if required and expands the storyline based on the players choices.
5. Before something is about to happen to the players, the game master shows signs and gives hints.
6. As something is happen to the players, the game master walks the players through the process.
7. The players overcome or learn from failure before continuing on their adventure.

### Attacks on Players <a name="npcattacks"></a>
Monsters, angry mobs, disgruntled shop keepers, other players; whoever is taking shots at you will do 1 damage to your health with each successful attempt.

The game master will roll the dice to decide the success or failure of the attempt. The game master should prepare non-playable characters prior to the game. The following table is provided as a starting point.

|NPC Type|Modifier|Health|
|---|---|---|
|Creatures|3|4|
|Humanoids|4|6|
|Mechanicals|5|8|
|Elites|6|10|

The NPC must roll below their modifier to be successful in their attack. Creatures therefore must roll 1 or 2, whilst Elites must roll 5 or less.

An NPC is considered dead when they reach 0 health. At this point they may be looted by the players. Looting is considered a physical activity.

### Player Death and Knock-outs <a name="playerdeath"></a>
Players are knocked out when they reach 0 health. Any attack that would lower them further has no effect.

Insta-death only occurs at the discretion of the game master; usually due to falling down a bottomless pit or some other nasty surprise.

Players are dead if they have not been healed by another player within 3 turns.

---

## Rolling the Dice <a name="rollthedice"></a>
When playing Murlocs and Boomsticks you require only one six-sided dice (1d6). This is because the game is overly simplified by design. More advanced RPG's may require you to use 20-sided dice (1d20) as well as other magical artifacts.

You must roll the dice whenever you perform an action of consequence (something risky), such as casting a spell, tricking a guard, trying to catch a fish, or trying to steal the candle.

Depending on your class and role, you may get to roll the dice up to two more times. Bonus dice are counted as separate rolls that count towards the success outcome, dice are not totalled together.

### Spellweaving for Shaman <a name="dicespellweaving"></a>
Any shaman refusing to spellweave out loud (that is, say, sing or yell), automatically fizzles and fails regardless of bonus dice. Murloc Peons cannot spellweave.. boo!

The skill modifier decided at character creation, along with your dice roll, decides whether your spellcast was successful or not.

* If your skill modifier is 1, 2 or 3, then you must roll 4+ to be successful.
* If your skill modifier is 4, 5 or 6, then you must roll 1, 2 or 3 to be successful.

### Bonus Dice for Spellweaving <a name="dicespellbonus"></a>
Murloc Shaman can get up to two bonus dice when spellweaving. Bonus dice are awarded for casting spells that make use of a school and technique that the player specialised in at character creation.

For example, if a player specialised in the *Fire* school and the *Create* technique, they would be awarded two bonus dice for spellweaving a fireball. If the player specialised in the *Fire* school but not in the *Create* technique, they would receive only one bonus dice.

### Mental Activities for Shaman <a name="diceshamanmental"></a>
Murloc Shaman have their heads filled with incantations and magical nonsense. They have sacrificed some of their marbles to make space for incantations and formulas.

* If your skill modifier is 1, 2 or 3, then you are magic-orientated. As a result you cannot complete the activity because your attention is distracted by magical fairies that only you can see.
* If your skill modifier is 4, 5 or 6, then you are a little more sane. You must roll a 1, 2 or 3 to be successful.

There are no bonus dice for Murloc Shaman when performing mental activities.

### Physical Activities for Shaman <a name="diceshamanphysical"></a>
Murloc Shaman are unable to perform physical activities such as holding a person down, stealing their money purse, or donning a physical disguise (without help from a peon).

The shaman would have you believe that this is because they are wiser and closer to the spirit world. The peons would probably respond by slapping them in the face with a wet fish.

### Mental Activities for Peons <a name="dicepeonmental"></a>
Some Murloc Peons were blessed with brains and the intelligence to not let their brain fall under the influence of magic. These peons excel at activities such as bluffing their way past guards, reading maps, understanding the value of objects, and so on.

* If your skill modifier is 1, 2 or 3, then you are mental-orientated. You must roll 4+ to be successful.
* If your skill modifier is 4, 5 or 6, then you are a little less stable. You must roll a 1, 2 or 3 to be successful.

You may be eligible for bonus dice.

### Physical Activity for Peons <a name="dicepeonphysical"></a>
All Murloc Peons excel at physical activities. A peon is happiest when doing instead of (not whilst,) thinking.

* To perform a physical activity successfully, you must roll your skill modifier + 1, or better. For example, if your skill modifier is 3, you must roll 4 or higher.

You may be eligible for bonus dice.

### Activity Combinations <a name="dicecombo"></a>

Some activities may require a combination of spellweaving, mental activities, and physical activities. Each should be rolled independently.

### Bonus Dice for Peons <a name="dicepeonbonus"></a>
Murloc Peons may use one bonus dice if the mental or physical activity to perform is covered by their role. For example;
* If they are attempting to apply bandages and their role is Healer.
* If they are attempting to read a map or fix a clock and their role is Tinker.
* If they are attempting to stab a creature with a pointy stick and their role is Hunter.

Murloc Peons may gain a second bonus dice if the player behind the character is under ten years of age. This is called *unfair advantage*.

### Success versus Failure <a name="dicesuccess"></a>
Success comes in varying degrees. The success outcome depends on how many successful dice rolls you make. This is why there is a benefit to using bonus dice.

The more successful dice rolls, the better the outcome.

|Successful Dice Rolls|Outcome|
|---|---|
|0|Everything gets worse in someway.|
|1|Partially successful, there may be some complications.|
|2|Successful.|
|3|Critical success. Rewarded with an additional outcome.|

## Spellweaving

Spells are woven by the tongue in Murlocs and Boomsticks. Spells are often divided into two themes,
mmmm mrrrggk (good magic) and nk mmmm mrrrggk (bad magic).

Spells are woven by saying (yes! spoken out loud,) a combination of *technique* and optional *modifier* followed by *school* and optional *modifier*. A shaman may cast any spell, even if they are
not skilled in the school or technique (but doing so comes with risk, explained later.)

You are free to play the game using either Common or Nerglish incantations.

For instance, to cast a fireball, you would use the magic incantation:
```
Goroth'dor tae'non!
```

### Spellweaving: Schools <a name="spellschools"></a>
|School|Overview|Incantation|Nerglish|
|---|---|---|---|
|Arcane|The air, lightning, magic missiles.|Aes|Mrmgmrll|
|Earth|The ground, minerals, non-organic.|Van|Bamrbl|
|Fire|Literal fire, light, heat, lava, etc.|Tae|Grmrmg|
|Frost|Frozen, water, all liquids except blood and lava.|Uar|Mmlmrmr|
|Nature|Animals, creatures, herbs and the trees.|Gol|Lblrrl|
|Holy|The physical body, healing, good vibes and peace.|Eon|Mglrbl|
|Shadow|Darkness, the senses, pain and suffering.|Gor|Lblrmr|
|Fel|Brings harm to all other schools. May contain demons.|Fel|Grmgrl|

### Spellweaving: Techniques <a name="spelltechniques"></a>
|Technique|Overview|Incantation|Nerglish|
|---|---|---|---|
|Create|Create, conjure, improve (including healing).|Goroth|Lblrmrlrgrrbmrgllbaba|
|Intellect|Detect, reveal, enhance senses and mind.|Norgan|Bllrmrlbmrblmrgllbaba|
|Transform|Add or remove properties, change.|Shala|Mrllrbmrrlmrmrgllbaba|
|Destroy|Destroy, make worse; opposite of create.|Geras|Lbmgmrmrmrllmrgllbaba|
|Manipulation|Control, dominate, manipulate without altering.|Sesche|Mrllmgmrllllrbmgmrgllbaba|

### Spellweaving: Modifiers <a name="spellmodifiers"></a>
|Modifier|Overview|Incantation|Nerglish|
|---|---|---|---|
|Growth|Grow, greater, giant, large.|'ir|'mlmr|
|Diminish|Lessen, lesser, small, shrink.|'dun|'brmlbl|
|Independence|As a separate entity, child, children, offspring.|'dor|'brlrmr|
|Movement|Move, moving, movement, freedom.|'non|'bllrbl|
|Attachment|Joining entities, reducing movement, attaching.|'rib|'mrmlgl|
|Area of Effect|Effect an area, and/or those in the area.|'ros|'mrlrmrll|

### Spellweaving: Concentration <a name="spellfocus"></a>

Most spells involving the **Create** and **Destroy** techniques should be perceived as having some degree of permanency. For example, creating a brickwall until it is destroyed; creating a fireball out of nothing until it blasts into it's target; destroying a brickwall; dousing a fire with water, and so on.

Spells involving **Intellect**, **Transform** and **Manipulation** techniques should, for the most part, be perceived as temporary effects. For example, casting polymorph; creating a shield of protection; mind controlling someone or something of lower intelligence, and so on.

Any entity, including players, under a mind control spell, cannot make decisions for themselves. However, any such spell is of a temporary nature and cannot be recast on the entity for another two turns (1 in 3).

Whilst a shaman is making use of one temporary spell they cannot cast another. It is for the Game Master to decide how liberal or strict this rule is applied.

### Spellweaving: Examples <a name="spellexamples"></a>

#### Fire
```
Fireball: Goroth'dor tae'non!
Fire Blast: Goroth tae'rib!
Flamestrike: Goroth'ros tae!
```

#### Frost
```
Frostbolt: Goroth'dor uar'non!
Frost Nova: Shala'ros uar'rib!
Blizzard: Goroth'ros uar!
```

#### Shadow
```
Shadow Bolt: Goroth'dor gor'non!
Drain Life: Geras eon'dun!
```

#### Other
```
Power Word - Shield: Shala'ros aes'dor!
Psychic Scream: Norgan'ros gol'non!
Shackle Undead: Shala'rib eon'rib!
Polymorph: Shala'dun gol'dun!
```

From the examples, you can see that when we invoke *Drain Life*, we append *eon* with *'dun*. If this was transliterated it would read as *Destroy. Life-force diminish*. In the *Polymorph* example we append *'dun* twice, in effect saying; *Transform shrink. Creature shrink*.

The concept is to be as flexible as possible whilst retaining some sense of sane process!

Another important concept (although the examples given are hypocritical of this notion); try not to let preconcieved ideas from video games limit your spellweaving creativity.

## Game Master Mechanics <a name="gamemaster"></a>

Above all, remember that Murlocs and Boomsticks is a foundation not a destination. As a game master, the players fun and adventure is in your hands. You are free to change the rules however you see fit; just be sure that your players know what changes you have made **before** they start playing.

### Roleplaying a Game Master <a name="gmroleplay"></a>

As a game master you are playing three roles:
1. As a storyteller, acting on behalf of the non-playable characters (NPC).
2. As a viewer, eager to find out how the players defeat the threat.
3. As a friend, encouraging and supporting players; asking questions that inspire.

Before a something happens to the players, give hints that it is about to happen. Ask the players what they might do..

> Game Master: "Onyxia is about to swoop down and use her mighty fire breath on the players. What do you do?"

The players take turns to describe what they will do; with the game master explaining the rolls they need to do in order to achieve their goal.

> Player: "Mimmil casts frostbolt at Onyxia.."
> Game Master: "Okay, roll 1d6 three times and let's see how great a frostbolt can be!"

Use the players failures to encourage and push them on to greater adventures. Remember to encourage the players. The roll of a dice changes the situation, for better or worse.

Ask questions that expand the lore of your world..

> Game Master: "Have you ever faced a dragon before? What happened?"


### Languages <a name="gmlanguages"></a>

The general language of the game is Common. Spells may be spoken by Incantation or Nerglish translation. Players may also participate entirely in Nerglish, providing the Game Master is able to interpert the language proficiently. This could provide a distinct advantage during guild vs guild battles.


### Disputes <a name="gmdisputes"></a>

In all disputes the youngest player, dumbest player, or the least likey to ever play a roleplaying game player, is always right. If there is a tie or debate regarding those characteristics, the disputees should roll 1d6, the highest roll is the winner of the dispute. A dispute winner may not dispute again for the remainder of the game.

If that seems at all unfair, remember that **you are all pretending to be murlocs** prancing around in a fantasy world with dragons, fairies, gnomes and unicorns.. and that your boss (unless incredibly cool,) would probably frown at your antics that kept you up until 2am on a work night.

### Adventure Creator <a name="gmcreator"></a>

If you are stuck for ideas on where to send your merry band of murlocs, or simply want to get started quickly, **roll 1d6 for each** of the following topics:

#### The antagonist..
* Adventurer wielding [[Deathbringer]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=17068).
* Twilight Cultist
* Onyxia
* Draenei Refugee
* Demon from the Burning Legion
* C'Thun

#### wants to..
* Create / Destroy
* Protect / Capture
* Empower / Steal
* Pacify / Occupy
* Peace Treaty / Dominion
* Build / Corrupt

#### the..
* World (Azeroth)
* Caverns of Time
* [Corrupted Ashbringer](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=22691)
* Dark Portal
* Swamp of Sorrows 
* [Gem of Trapped Innocents](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=23057)

#### which will..
* Destroy Azeroth
* Reverse Time
* Enslave all Murlocs
* Start the Burning Legion Invasion
* Rip a Hole in Reality
* Make Everything Awesome
